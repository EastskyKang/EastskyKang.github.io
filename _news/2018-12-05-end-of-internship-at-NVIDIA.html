<p>
    I have finished my 6-month internship at NVIDIA. 
    During my internship, I worked on research project on "Super-Resolution for Aliased Images" for computer games and animation that is now part of NVIDIA Ansel and NVIDIA DLSS.

    I would like to express my sincere thanks to my colleagues and supervisors:
    <ul>
        <li>Artem Rozantsev at NVIDIA</li>
        <li>Marco Foco at NVIDIA</li>
        <li>Adam Moravanszky at NVIDIA</li>
        <li>Team DL-Zurich</li>
        <li>NVIDIA Switzerland</li>
        <li>Prof. Marco Hutter at ETH</li>
    </ul>
</p>
