<p>
    I am happy to announce that I am starting my Ph.D. at <a href="http://crl.ethz.ch/">ETH Computational Robotics Lab.</a> with the guidance of Prof. Stelian Coros. 
    I am currently involved in legged robot locomotion projects at CRL and currently working with our Ghost Vision 60, Laikago and Spot Mini robots.
