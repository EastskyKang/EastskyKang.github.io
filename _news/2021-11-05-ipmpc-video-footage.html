I and my colleague Flavio De Vincenti submitted a paper "Versatile and Efficient Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Quadrupedal Locomotion" to RAL presenting our new model predictive control method for robust quadrupedal locomotion. A footage of our hardware experiments is available <a href="https://youtu.be/rUv4jwwKFiY">online</a>. Please stay tuned until more details are available!
