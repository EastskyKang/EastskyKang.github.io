I am excited to share that Fatemeh Zargarbashi will be presenting her recent paper, "Robot Keyframing: Learning Locomotion with High-Level Objectives via Mixture of Dense and Sparse Rewards," in which I participated, at the upcoming **2024 Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2024).** 

Fatehmeh's presentation is scheduled for **Poster Session 3 on November 7th, from 16:00 to 17:30.**  If you are attending the conference, please stop by her poster to learn more.
