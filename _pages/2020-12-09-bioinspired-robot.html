<p>
    We (the Computational Robotics Lab) build bio-inspired quadrupedal robots that resemble beloved animals. 
    Our research projects explore the challenge of designing mechanisms and control strategies that can generate more animal-like walking
    motion for legged robots. 
</p>

<p>
    Our research topics are broad-ranging from control and planning of legged robots to design
    optimization, digital fabrication and finally human-robot interaction.
</p>

<p>
    We are looking for talented students who are passionate to join our journey to build a bio-inspired legged robot. 
    Please contact us if you are intested in participating in one of our 3-month (14-weeks, part-time) or 6-month (full-time) research projects at Computational Robotics Lab.

<h2>List of Available Projects</h2>

<p>
    Unfortunately, there is no project we offer for students at the moment :(
</p>

<!-- <p>
    We are currently looking for self-motivated Master students who wants to participate in one of our 3-month
    (14-weeks, part-time) or 6-month (full-time) research projects. Please send your CV and short motivation letter to

<h3>HW deployment of model-based controllers using Bayesian optimization</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Master's thesis (6 months)</li>
    <li>Starting date: ASAP</li>
    <li>Supervisors: <a href="mailto:kangd@ethz.ch">Dongho Kang</a> and <a href="mailto:sukhijab@ethz.ch">Bhavya Sukhija</a></li>
    <li>Prerequisite courses:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Robot Dynamics</b> or <b>Computational Models of Motion for Character Animation and Robotics
                    (required)</b></li>
            <li><b>Probabilistic Artificial Intelligence (required)</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Required skills:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Strong C++ / Python programming skills (required)</b></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    State-of-the-art model-based control methods are capable of performing highly agile and dynamic legged locomotion.
    However, they require an accurate system dynamics model that is often unavailable due to our limited understanding 
    of real-world physics and inevitable simplifications for reducing computational burden. Therefore, model-based 
    controllers often do not perform well off-the-shelf on hardware and require considerable parameter tuning. This 
    tuning process is time-consuming and in some instances can also harm the hardware. Furthermore, it may have to be 
    repeated for different environment settings or, in case of legged robots, gait patterns.
</p>

<p>
    We pursue to improve the robustness and the tracking performance of a model-based controller on robot hardware by 
    bridging the gap between simplified/modelled and real-world dynamics.
</p>

<p>See <a href="/assets/pdf/quadBO_description.pdf">the project description</a> for more details.</p> -->

<!-- <p>
    In this project, you will implement one of the current state-of-the-art model-based controller or state estimation
    algorithm for legged robots in C++. We aim to deploy the new controller/estimator to Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot,
    and benchmark the performance.
</p>

<p>
    Note. this project is a rather research engineering project requires rich engineering experiences in control and
    robot programming. We do not aim to publish a paper.

<h2>For students from research or educational institutes other than ETH</h2>

<p>
    The Master's semester project and thesis project are part of the Master's degree program at ETH Zurich and <b>we
        cannot provide any financial support for cost of living and neither legal support for your visa process.</b>
    However, there are plenty of opportunities to visit ETH for research exchanging purposes. So please make sure you
    can visit ETH and Switzerland
    with legitimated permission supported by one of these programmes before you contact us.
