<p>
    We are building bio-inspired quadrupedal robots.
    Our goal is to design mechanisms and control strategies that can generate more animal-like walking
    motion for legged robots and eventually to bring those robots to people's daily life.
</p>

<p>
    Our research interests are broad-ranging from control and planning of legged robots to design
    optimization, digital fabrication and finally human-robot interaction.

<h2>List of Available Projects</h2>

<p>
    We are currently looking for self-motivated Master students who wants to participate in one of our 3-month
    (14-weeks, part-time) or 6-month (full-time) research projects. Please send your CV and short motivation letter to
    <a href="mailto:kangd@ethz.ch">Dongho Kang</a>
    if you are interested in.

<h3>HW deployment of model-based controllers</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Semester project (14 weeks)</li>
    <li>Starting date: From Jan., 2022</li>
    <li>Prerequisite courses:
        <ul>
            <li><b>Robot Dynamics</b> or <b>Computational Models of Motion for Character Animation and Robotics
                    (required)</b></li>
            <li><b>Recursive Estimation (required)</b></li>
            <li>Model Predictive Control (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Required skills:
        <ul>
            <li><b>C++ programming (required)</b></li>
            <li>experiences with ROS (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In this project, you will implement one of the current state-of-the-art model-based controller or state estimation
    algorithm for legged robots in C++. We aim to deploy the new controller/estimator to Unitree A1 quadrupedal robot,
    and benchmark the performance.
</p>

<p>
    Note. this project is a rather research engineering project requires rich engineering experiences in control and
    robot programming. We do not aim to publish a paper.

<h2>For students from research or educational institutes other than ETH</h2>

<p>
    The Master's semester project and thesis project are part of the Master's degree program at ETH Zurich and <b>we
        cannot provide any financial support for cost of living and neither legal support for your visa process.</b>
    However, there are plenty of opportunities to visit ETH for research exchanging purposes. So please make sure you
    can visit ETH and Switzerland
    with legitimated permission supported by one of these programmes before you contact us.
