I am a doctoral student in computer science based in Zurich, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. 
From 2019, I am a scientific assistant of the [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich, under the supervision of Prof. Stelian Coros.

The goal of my research is to create legged robots that exhibit natural and animal-like behaviors. 
Thus, my research interests are broad ranging to legged locomotion control, computational models of character animation and design optimization for robotics applications. 

Other than my professional bio, I am from Seoul, South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡·. 
As I describe myself, I am a video game fan, and a classical music lover. 
In my free time, I hike beautiful mountains in Switzerland, play video games, go to orchestral concerts and watch Ghibli and Disney movies (specifically, I am a big fan of Star Wars series). :D

------
I am currently looking for self-motivated Master students (from ETH or students from any other institutes who can visit ETH Zurich by an available exchanging program) who are passionate to join our journey to build a bio-inspired legged robot. 
If you are intested in participating in one of our 3-month (14-weeks, part-time) or 6-month (full-time) research projects at Computational Robotics Lab, please see more details [here](/bio-inspired-robots/) if you are interested.

------
The Computational Robotics Lab is looking for a talented mechatronics engineer who has a strong background in designing, and building a robotic system. If you are interested in joing CRL as a part-time or a full-time research engineer, please contact us through <code>crl-jobs (at) inf (dot) ethz (dot) ch</code>: more details are availabe [here](/bio-inspired-robots/).
