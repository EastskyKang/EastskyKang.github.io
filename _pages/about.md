I am a doctoral student in computer science based in Zurich, Switzerland. 
From 2019, I am a member of [Computational Robotics Lab](http://crl.ethz.ch), ETH Zurich, led by Prof. Stelian Coros.

My research aims to generate natural, animal-like legged robot motion. 
Thus, my research interests are broad ranging to legged locomotion control, computational model of character animation and finally design optimization for robotics applications. 

Other than my professional bio, I am from Seoul, South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· and currently live in Zurich, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. 
As I describe myself, I am an open source enthusiast, a video game fan, and a classical music lover. 
In my free time, I hike beautiful mountains in Switzerland, play video games, go to orchestral concerts and watch Ghibli and Disney movies (specifically, I am a big fan of Star Wars series). :D

------
I am currently looking for self-motivated Master students (from ETH or students from any other institutes who can visit ETH Zurich by an available exchanging program) who are passionate to join our journey to build a bio-inspired legged robot. 
If you are intested in participating in one of our 3-month (14-weeks, part-time) or 6-month (full-time) research projects at Computational Robotics Lab. 
Please see more details [here](/bio-inspired-robots/) if you are interested.



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.
Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`.
