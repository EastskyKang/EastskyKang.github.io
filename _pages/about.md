Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

My research aims to generate natural, animal-like legged robot motion. 
Thus, my research interests are broad ranging to legged locomotion control, computational model of character animation and finally design optimization for robotics applications. 
Please see my curriculum vitae [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_LJE2xl-80-AA4Tb0SPG62aufeCbYslc/view?usp=sharing) for a more detailed professional biography.

Other than my professional bio, I am from Seoul, South Korea ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡· and currently live in Zurich, Switzerland ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­. 
As I describe myself, I am an open source enthusiast, an indie game fan, and a classical music lover. 
In my free time, I hike beautiful mountains in Switzerland, go to orchestral concerts and watch lovely Ghibli and Disney animations. :D

I am currently looking for self-motivated Master students (from ETH or students from any other institutes who can visit ETH Zurich by an available exchanging program) who are passionate to join our journey to build a bio-inspired legged robot. 
If you are intested in participating in one of our 3-month (14-weeks, part-time) or 6-month (full-time) research projects at Computational Robotics Lab. 
Please see more details [here](/bio-inspired-robots/) if you are interested.
