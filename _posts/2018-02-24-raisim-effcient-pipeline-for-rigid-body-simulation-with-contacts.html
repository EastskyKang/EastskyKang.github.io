  <b>RaiSim</b> is a rigid body simulator developed by researchers at <a href="http://www.rsl.ethz.ch/">RSL, ETH
    Zurich</a> (Jemin Hwangbo and Dongho Kang). 
    The goal of RaiSim project is to provide simulation for data-driven robotics and animation research.

  <h1>Abstract</h1>
  
  <p>
    Solving contact dynamics is a NP-hard problem due to its non-convexity and discontinuity. In order to make the
    problem tractable, rigid-body simulators often over-relax the contact problem that might leads to inaccurate result.
    In this project, the multi-contact simulation pipeline <i>RaiSim</i> was implemented based on <a
    href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8255551/">Hwangbo’s method</a> that results in accurate
    solution in an efficient manner. By using Hwangbo’s method, the penetration problem is significantly reduced.
    Moreover, RaiSim obtains contact solution using sparse formulation of contact problem thus fast and
    memory-efficient. For the integration, RaiSim computes gyroscopic force by Implicit Euler scheme and integrate the
    object velocity by Semi-implicit Euler that improves numerical stability of the rigid-body simulation. In the
    benchmark tests, our simulation pipeline performed similarly or better than the state-of-the-art simulators in terms
    of speed and better in terms of accuracy. Remarkably, it can simulate 18-DOF quadruped robot at 29k time step per
    second in a 12 contact points case. This performance could be achievable by the virtue of accurate and fast solver,
    sparse representation of the contact problem, efficient memory management and numerically stable integration scheme.
