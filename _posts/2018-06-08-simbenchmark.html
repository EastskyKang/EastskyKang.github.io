    I worked on this project while I was developing <a href="http://raisim.com/">RAISIM</a>.
    We evaluated a few widely used physics engines for robotics and machine learning applications. The list of the
    engines is as follows:
    <ul>
        <li>RAISIM</li>
        <li>Bullet Physics</li>
        <li>Open Dynamics Engine</li>
        <li>Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact (a.k.a. MuJoCo)</li>
        <li>DART Sim</li>
    </ul>
