<p>
    Unity does not support run-time mesh import from files outside of the project for performance. 
    Fortunately, <a href="https://bitbucket.org/Starnick/assimpnet">AssimpNet</a> provides nice Unity plugin enables loading various formats of mesh objects.
</p>

<p>
    I wrote a Unity package based on this: <b>UnityMeshImporter</b>. This package loads mesh file by AssimpNet and convert it to a Unity GameObject. The source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/eastskykang/UnityMeshImporter">GitHub</a>.
</p>
<p>
    It just works like this: 
</p>

{% highlight c# %}
using UnityMeshImporter;

string meshFile = "YOUR-MESH-FILE-PATH";
var ob = MeshImporter.Load(meshFile); 
{% endhighlight %}

    Very simple!
