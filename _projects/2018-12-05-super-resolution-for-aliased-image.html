    During my internship at NVIDIA, I worked on the project "Super-Resolution for Aliased Image".
    The main idea is building a training scheme for a neural network that can generate visually attractive upscaled image for game and animation.

    My team presented intermediate results at GTC Europe 2018. 
    The presentation slides and the video recording are available on websites:

        Upon GTC, We even have improved the concept and as a result, our trained networks are now part of NVIDIA Ansel and NVIDIA DLSS.
