<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>
In this paper, we explore the challenge of generating animal-like walking motions for legged robots. 
To this end, we propose a versatile and robust control pipeline that combines a state-of-the-art model-based controller with a data-driven technique that is commonly used in computer animation.
We demonstrate the efficacy of our control framework on a variety of quadrupedal robots in  simulation. 
We show, in particular, that our approach can automatically reproduce key characteristics of animal motions, including speed-specific gaits, unscripted footfall patterns for nonperiodic motions, and natural small variations in overall body movements.
